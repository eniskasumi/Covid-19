        <h1>Economic Crisis</h1>
        <div class="economic-box1">
         
        <p>Covid-19 in our country Kosovo has created a serious economic crisis.
        In March, when the first case of Covid-19 came out in Kosovo, the state decided to close everything to prevent the virus from spreading, as it had only just begun to spread.
        The first two cases were reported on March 13, 2020, on the same day all schools were closed, gastronomy, fitness and in time we were in quarantine.
        Unfortunately, Kosovo was not so prepared, but decided for each company (employees) to give 170 euros per month but some companies were not registered and some did not have employees registered in the state.
        Kosovo is strongly exposed to the COVID-19 crisis through weaknesses in
        its health and social protection systems and high levels of 
        unemployment and informality.
        </p>
         </div>

         <br>
        <div class="economic-box2">
        <p>The sectors most affected by the pandemic in Kosovo are gastronomy, manufacturing and construction, while those that benefited most economically from the pandemic situation in the country are pharmacies and food markets.
        Kosovo's economy was heavily affected by the COVID-19 crisis. 
        In 2020 Kosovo's economy recorded a contraction of 6.9%, mainly due todeclines in consumption, especially diaspora-related exports oftravel services and investments. The medium and long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Kosovo will largely depend on pre-existing socio-economic vulnerabilities. Taking into account pre-existing weaknesses can help policymakers determine who will need help most and design and target policies accordingly.
